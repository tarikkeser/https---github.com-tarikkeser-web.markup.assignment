                <h2>THE FIRST STEP </h2>
                <p> Disabled parking areas are the first step for handicapped individuals to venture away from home. It
                    is difficult to step into the world and
                    change their environment in daily life. Reaching the bus/train stations is really challenging for
                    them. Therefore, handicapped individuals mostly wish to travel with their vehicles. In that case,
                    they desperately need a specific parking area.</p>

                <h2>WHY A SPECIFIC PARKING SPOT?</h2>
                <p>The reason is that they need a more space to getting in and off and move around their vehicles
                    easily.
                    For instance: it is not possible for them to get out of the vehicle with a walking stick and take
                    wheelchairs or walk frame/walk assistant out of the trunk when they are in a ordinary parking spot.
