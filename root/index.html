    <h2>THE FIRST STEP </h2>
    <p> Disabled parking areas are the first step for handicapped individuals to venture away from home. It is difficult to step into the world and 
        change their environment in daily life. Reaching the bus/train stations is really challenging for them. Therefore, handicapped individuals mostly wish to travel with their vehicles. In that case, they desperately need a specific parking area.</p>
